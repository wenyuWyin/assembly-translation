# The Red-Bellied Snake (RBS) Language Translator
### Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a translator for the Red-Bellied Snake (RBS) Language, a restricted subset of Python. The translator converts RBS programs into Pep/9 assembly code, simulating the functionality of a low-level virtual machine. The project demonstrates tree analysis and utilizes the Visitor design pattern for efficient AST traversal and translation.
